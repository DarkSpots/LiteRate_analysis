# LiteRate
LiteRate is a program implementing birth-death models within a Bayesian framework to estimates diversification dynamics from cultural occurrence data. The model detects statistically-significant rate shifts in the history of the cultural population that theoretically correspond with major historical events and/or the action of evolutionary processes.
